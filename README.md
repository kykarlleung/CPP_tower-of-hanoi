## What is Tower of Hanoi?

The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle.</br>
It consists of three rods and a number of disks of different sizes, which can slide onto any rod.</br>
The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape.

The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:
<ul>
	<li>Only one disk can be moved at a time.</li>
	<li>Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.</li>
	<li>No larger disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.</li>
</ul>
